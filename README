End goal for this project:

This will be a multi-user application where users make an account, contribute feeds to a very large inventory (split up into categories like "News" and other topics), and then each user has a list of "server names from which they don't want content." So say,for instance, that in my "news" feed, I really don't want to receive content from one of the news feeds in the "big list," I can put the server name on my list of "Sifters" and I won't recieve any aggregated news from that filter.

This project is in the beginning stages. Here are a few things that I can think of off the top of my head that I want to get done:

TO DO:

-make the feed aggregator
	-when creating a new feed, save the feed url to a txt file
-design
-tag cloud
-link the tags
-can i make the feed in the center of the home page dynamic?
-user sign-up stuff
	-security

If you wanna see where I'm at with this, you'd have to download the source. Then, cd into the parent directory. Then, run "./script/server" and open "http://localhost:3000/" in your browser.
